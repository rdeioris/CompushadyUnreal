# Rendering PointClouds

This tutorial will show how to use the rasterizer and the blitter to render pointclouds (in XYZ/ASCII format) with both points and billboard quads.

The XYZ/ASCII format will be gzipped to show how Compushady con decompress and upload to the gpu on the fly (in asynchronous/nonblocking mode).

The tutorial will use HLSL for both the Vertex and Pixel shaders, but at the end of the tutorial you will find the GLSL variant.

## Step0: loading the data in a StructuredBuffer

## Step1: rendering points

## Step2: moving to quads

## Optional Step 3: storing the shaders in a file

## Optional Step 4: using GLSL
